# CI/CD Pipeline Guidelines

## Overview
This repository provides a structured approach to implementing a **CI/CD pipeline** for a FastAPI application using Docker. It includes steps to pull the code, build and run the Docker container, and expose the application on port 8000.

## Features
- **FastAPI Application** served via Uvicorn
- **Dockerized Setup** for easy deployment
- **CI/CD Workflow** (GitHub Actions integration recommended)

## Project Structure
```
├── .github/workflows/   # CI/CD workflows
├── src/                 # FastAPI application source code
├── Dockerfile           # Containerization setup
├── requirements.txt     # Python dependencies
├── README.md            # Documentation
└── provide_environment_name/ # Virtual environment directory
```

## Steps to Set Up and Run the Application

### 1. Pull the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Harihararaj/CI-CD-pipeline-guidelines.git
cd CI-CD-pipeline-guidelines
```

### 2. Build the Docker Image
```bash
docker build -t fastapi-app .
```

### 3. Run the Docker Container
```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 fastapi-app
```

### 4. Access the Application
Once the container is running, open your browser or use `curl` to test the application:
```
http://localhost:8000
```

## CI/CD Pipeline
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**
  - Runs automated tests on every push/pull request
  - Enforces linting and static analysis
- **Continuous Deployment (CD)**
  - Builds and pushes Docker images to a container registry
  - Deploys the application to a staging/production environment
